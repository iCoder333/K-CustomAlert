# KCustomAlert

Let’s not use the default AlertController in our upcoming iOS Apps because it doesn’t feel awesome. To make the alert look better and customised, I just created Common Repo which can be used very easily for all kind of Alerts. So, let’s use this from now on.


# Simple and easy alerts to use instead of default AlertController.

# Separate Xib is provided to customize as pr your need. 

# Callbacks are easily handled by using Closures.

# For Simple one:

                message: "This is a simple alert with a logo and message",
                descMsg: "",
                itemimage: nil,
                actions: nil)

# For More Content: 


            let actionDic : [String: () -> Void] = [ "YES" : { (
                    print("tapped YES")
                ) }, "NO" : { (
                    print("tapped NO")
                ) }]
